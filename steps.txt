question: How to use the gitignore file?

[In App] Create the Event Post first because that is what app is designated to
do.
We will create event_post model
$ rails g model event_post title:string address:string city:string state:string
zip_code:string description:text event_contact_number:string
event_contact_email_address:string event_link:string

$ rake db:migrate

$ rails g controller event_posts

[In App]
1) Go to EventPostController and add
def index
end
2) Go to routes and add
resources :event_posts
root 'event_posts#index'

[In Terminal]
note: will show you your routes.
$ rake routes
Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                     Controller#Action
   event_posts GET    /event_posts(.:format)          event_posts#index
               POST   /event_posts(.:format)          event_posts#create
new_event_post GET    /event_posts/new(.:format)      event_posts#new

    event_post GET    /event_posts/:id(.:format)      event_posts#show
               PATCH  /event_posts/:id(.:format)      event_posts#update
               PUT    /event_posts/:id(.:format)      event_posts#update
               DELETE /event_posts/:id(.:format)      event_posts#destroy
          root GET    /                               event_posts#index
